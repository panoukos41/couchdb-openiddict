[CouchDB](https://couchdb.apache.org/) store provider for the [Openiddict](https://github.com/openiddict/openiddict-core) using [CouchDB.NET](https://github.com/matteobortolazzo/couchdb-net).

The project was insipired from the existing [OpenIddict](https://github.com/openiddict/openiddict-core) MongoDB implementation.

# Before Getting started
This project was made in a hurry and was live tested on a really simple application so some things might not work as expected. Feel free to open an issue and even a pull request.

I will try my best to support the project and provide tests and samples whenever i find time.

Thanks for looking at this library ðŸ˜„

# Getting Started

By default a database named `openiddict` is used but you can change it using the options overload.

Your [CouchDB](https://couchdb.apache.org/) database must implement the [ddoc.json](ddocs/ddoc.json) in the [ddocs](/ddocs) folder.

At your `Startup.cs` add your `ICouchClient` in DI and use the following code.
```csharp
// Configure OpenIddict stores and services.
services.AddOpenIddict()
    // Register the OpenIddict core components and to use the CouchDb stores and models.
    .AddCore(options => options.UseCouchDb())
```

Or you can provide your own instance of `ICouchClient` in the options.
```csharp
// Configure OpenIddict stores and services.
// With custom client.
services.AddOpenIddict()
    // Register the OpenIddict core components and to use the CouchDb stores and models.
    .AddCore(options => options
        .UseCouchDb(options => options
            .UseClient(new CouchClient("http://localhost:5984"))))
```

You can also customize the `design document` and `views` used by the library. More information as to what a view returns and when can be found in the [ddocs](/ddocs) fodler.

```csharp
services.AddIdentity<CouchDbUser, CouchDbRole>()
        .AddCouchDbStores(options => options
            .UseViewOptions(new CouchDbOpenIddictViewOptions
            {
                Document = "openiddict";
                Application = "application";
                ApplicationClientId = "application.client_id";
                ApplicationRedirectUri = "application.redirect_uris";
                ApplicationPostLogoutRedirectUri = "application.post_logout_redirect_uris";
                Authorization = "authorization";
                AuthorizationApplicationId = "authorization.application_id";
                AuthorizationSubject = "authorization.subject";
                AuthorizationPrune = "authorization.prune";
                Scope = "scope";
                ScopeName = "scope.name";
                ScopeResources = "scope.resources";
                Token = "token";
                TokenApplicationId = "token.application_id";
                TokenAuthorizationId = "token.authorization_id";
                TokenReferenceId = "token.reference_id";
                TokenSubject = "token.subject";
                TokenPrune = "token.prune";
            })));
```

Services are *registered as Singleton* since `ICouchClient` is/should be registered as such and no other dependency is needed.
